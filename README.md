Binary Search Tree (BST)
Overview
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with core operations including insertion (iterative and recursive), node searching, and traversal methods (DFS, BFS).

Features
Insert (Iterative & Recursive): Adds a new node to the tree.
Search (Iterative & Recursive): Finds a node by value.
Traversals:
DFS Pre-Order: Root → Left → Right
DFS In-Order: Left → Root → Right
DFS Post-Order: Left → Right → Root
BFS: Level-order traversal
